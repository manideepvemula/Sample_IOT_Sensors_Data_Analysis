# Sample_IOT_Sensors_Data_Analysis
The acched data file contains temperature data of freezers spread across 4 sites for somedays. sampled at 1 minute. 
Now we will analys the data and draw as many inferences as possible. 
But Major focus of the analysis is on the lines of - 

1. The data has many missing values, try out different methods for filling these missing values. 
2. Finding the operational temperature range of each freezer.
3. Finding the daily average of door open duration per freezer.
4. Classifying these freezers based on their operational health.

After this project you will be well versed in Python programming, Data understanding, Data preperation, Clustering.
