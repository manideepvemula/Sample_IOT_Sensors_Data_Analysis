# Sample_IOT_Sensors_Data_Analysis
The acched data file contains temperature data of freezers spread across 4 sites for somedays. sampled at 1 minute. 
Now we will analys the data and draw as many inferences as possible. 
But Major focus of the analysis is on the lines of - 

1. Treating missing values
2. Finding max and min temperatures of each freezer.
3. Finding daily average of door open duration per freezer.
4. Classifying freezers operational health.

After this project you will be well versed in Python programming, Data understanding, Data preperation, Clustering.
